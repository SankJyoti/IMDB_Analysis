1. movie table:
   - Columns: id, title, year, date_published, duration, country, worlwide_gross_income, languages, production_company
   - This table likely stores information about movies, including their titles, release years, production details, and more.

2. genre table:
   - Columns: movie_id, genre
   - This table likely stores information about movie genres and associates them with specific movies using the 'movie_id' column.

3. director_mapping table:
   - Columns: movie_id, name_id
   - This table may be used to map directors to movies. The 'movie_id' links to a specific movie, and 'name_id' likely links to a director's name in another table.

4. role_mappin` table:
   - Columns: movie_id, name_id, category
   - This table could be used to map roles or characters to movies. The 'movie_id' links to a specific movie, 'name_id' links to a person's name, and 'category' may specify the role or category of the person in the movie.

5. names table:
   - Columns: id, name, height, date_of_birth, known_for_movies

6. ratings table:
   - Columns: movie_id, avg_rating, total_votes, median_rating
   - This table may store information about movie ratings, including average ratings, total votes, and median ratings for each movie.

Based on the column names, the tables are connected as follows:

- The 'movie' table serves as the central table, containing information about movies. Other tables, such as 'genre', 'director_mapping', 'role_mapping', and 'ratings', are linked to specific movies using the 'movie_id' column.

- The 'genre' table is connected to the 'movie' table through the 'movie_id' column, associating genres with movies.

- The 'director_mapping' table is also connected to the 'movie' table through the 'movie_id' column, indicating which directors were involved in each movie.

- The 'role_mapping' table connects to both the 'movie' table and the 'names' table through the 'movie_id' and 'name_id' columns, linking specific roles or characters in movies to individuals.

- The 'ratings' table is associated with the 'movie' table via the 'movie_id' column, providing rating-related data for each movie.

- The 'names' table is linked to other tables like 'director_mapping' and 'role_mapping' using the 'name_id' column, allowing you to retrieve additional information about people involved in movies.

These connections enable you to query and retrieve information about movies, genres, directors, roles, ratings, and individuals involved in the film industry while maintaining data integrity and relationships between the tables.
